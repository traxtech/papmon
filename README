WARNING: This is work in progress, it should not be used on production servers.

This is PAPMON, The Play APlication MONitoring module.

Its goals are to gather every minutes statistics on :
 - The JVM
 - Hibernate
 - Logs

These statictics are stored in the Play! database.

PAPMON is a regular Play! module, it must be declated in the application.conf. Hibernates statistics are gathered only if 'hibernate.generate_statistics=true' is present in your application.conf.

Futures improvements will include:
 - tags to displays statistics using the Google Chart Tools
 - statistics cleaners to unclutter the DB

Feels free to drop suggestions :)
