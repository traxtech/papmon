WARNING: This is work in progress, it should not be used on production servers.

This is PAPMON, The Play APlication MONitoring module.

Its goals are to gather every minutes statistics on :
 - The JVM
 - Hibernate
 - Logs

These statictics are stored in the Play! database.

PAPMON is a regular Play! module, it must be declated in the application.conf. Hibernates statistics are gathered only if 'hibernate.generate_statistics=true' is present in your application.conf.

Some statistics can be used to generate an image (using Google Chart Tools) by using tags:

    #{papmon.jvm.freeMemory title:'Free memory - Last hour', width:350, height:250, range:'hour' /}
    #{papmon.jvm.maxMemory title:'Max memory - Last hour', width:350, height:250, range:'hour' /}
    #{papmon.jvm.usedMemory title:'Used memory - Last Hour', width:350, height:250, range:'hour' /}


Futures improvements will include:
 - more tags to displays more statistics
 - statistics cleaners to unclutter the DB
 - javadoc + user guide

Feels free to drop suggestions :)
